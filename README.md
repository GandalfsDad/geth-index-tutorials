# Ethereum Data Indexing

This was inspired by watching this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4akZVr3FuWg&t=701s) from ETH Bogota and the examples in this [website](https://goethereumbook.org/event-read/). So far I've managed to fetch some data, my next step will be to handle storage in some temporary DB and to create a containerised version that allows me to improve my Docker.
